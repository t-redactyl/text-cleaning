      "      There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child.  All alone,  in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by  spinning, weaving, and sewing.  The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her  to her work, and educated her in all that is good.  When the girl was fifteen years old, the old  woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, \"Dear daughter, I feel my end  drawing near.  I leave thee the little house, which will protect thee from wind and weather, and  my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which thou canst earn thy bread.\"  Then she laid her hands  on the girl's head, blessed her, and said, \"Only preserve the love of God in thy heart, and all will  go well with thee.\"  Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the  maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect.  And now the  maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and  the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did.  It seemed as if the flax in the room  increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a  shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and  even had something to share with others.\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "      About this time, the son of the King was travelling about the country looking for a bride.  He was  not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one.  So he said, \"She shall be my wife  who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.\"  When he came to the village where the  maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest  girl in the place?  They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in  the small house quite at the end of the village.  The rich girl was sitting in all her splendour  before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him,  and made him a low curtsey.  He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on.  When he came to the  house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room.  He stopped  his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at  her spinning-wheel, busily spinning.  She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was  looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning.  I do not know  whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until the King's  son had ridden away again.  Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, \"It is so warm in  this room!\" but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his  hat.  Then she sat down to work again in her own room and went on with her spinning, and a  saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her  mind, and she sang these words to herself,\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <blockquote>\n",
      "      \"Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,\n",
      "      <br/>\n",
      "      And here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.\"\n",
      "     </blockquote>\n",
      "     And what do you think happened?  The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of  the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was  dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it.  Before  long, it had entirely vanished from her sight.  As she had now no spindle, the girl took the  weaver's shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave.\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "      The spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end,  reached the prince.  \"What do I see?\" he cried; \"the spindle certainly wants to show me the way!\"  turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.  The girl was, however, sitting at  her work singing,\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <blockquote>\n",
      "      \"Shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day,\n",
      "      <br/>\n",
      "      And guide the wooer to me, I pray.\"\n",
      "     </blockquote>\n",
      "     Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.  Before the threshold,  however, it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet  beheld.  Lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden ground in the centre  green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their  heads in between them, brightly-coloured birds were sitting in the branches above; they lacked  nothing but the gift of song.  The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow  of its own accord.\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "      As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew.  She held the needle in her hand and  sang,\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <blockquote>\n",
      "      \"Needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine,\n",
      "      <br/>\n",
      "      Prepare for a wooer this house of mine.\"\n",
      "     </blockquote>\n",
      "     Then the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about the room as quick as  lightning.  It was just as if invisible spirits were working; they covered tables and benches with  green cloth in an instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken curtains.   Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden saw through the window the white  feathers of the prince, whom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread.  He alighted,  stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the maiden in  her poor garments, but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves.  \"Thou  art the poorest and also the richest,\" said he to her.  \"Come with me, thou shalt be my bride.\"  She  did not speak, but she gave him her hand.  Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her on to  his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great  rejoicings.  The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber, and held in  great honour.\n",

       "[<div class=\"GM\" id=\"text\">\\n         <p align=\"justify\">There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child.  All alone,  in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by  spinning, weaving, and sewing.  The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her  to her work, and educated her in all that is good.  When the girl was fifteen years old, the old  woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, \"Dear daughter, I feel my end  drawing near.  I leave thee the little house, which will protect thee from wind and weather, and  my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which thou canst earn thy bread.\"  Then she laid her hands  on the girl's head, blessed her, and said, \"Only preserve the love of God in thy heart, and all will  go well with thee.\"  Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the  maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect.  And now the  maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and  the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did.  It seemed as if the flax in the room  increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a  shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and  even had something to share with others. </p>\\n         <p> About this time, the son of the King was travelling about the country looking for a bride.  He was  not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one.  So he said, \"She shall be my wife  who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.\"  When he came to the village where the  maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest  girl in the place?  They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in  the small house quite at the end of the village.  The rich girl was sitting in all her splendour  before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him,  and made him a low curtsey.  He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on.  When he came to the  house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room.  He stopped  his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at  her spinning-wheel, busily spinning.  She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was  looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning.  I do not know  whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until the King's  son had ridden away again.  Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, \"It is so warm in  this room!\" but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his  hat.  Then she sat down to work again in her own room and went on with her spinning, and a  saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her  mind, and she sang these words to herself, </p>\\n         <p> </p>\\n         <blockquote> \"Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,<br/>\\n           And here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.\"</blockquote>\\nAnd what do you think happened?  The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of  the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was  dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it.  Before  long, it had entirely vanished from her sight.  As she had now no spindle, the girl took the  weaver's shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave.\\n<p> The spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end,  reached the prince.  \"What do I see?\" he cried; \"the spindle certainly wants to show me the way!\"  turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.  The girl was, however, sitting at  her work singing,</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<blockquote> \"Shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day,<br/>\\n  And guide the wooer to me, I pray.\"</blockquote>\\nImmediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.  Before the threshold,  however, it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet  beheld.  Lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden ground in the centre  green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their  heads in between them, brightly-coloured birds were sitting in the branches above; they lacked  nothing but the gift of song.  The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow  of its own accord.\\n<p> As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew.  She held the needle in her hand and  sang,</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<blockquote> \"Needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine,<br/>\\n  Prepare for a wooer this house of mine.\"</blockquote>\\nThen the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about the room as quick as  lightning.  It was just as if invisible spirits were working; they covered tables and benches with  green cloth in an instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken curtains.   Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden saw through the window the white  feathers of the prince, whom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread.  He alighted,  stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the maiden in  her poor garments, but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves.  \"Thou  art the poorest and also the richest,\" said he to her.  \"Come with me, thou shalt be my bride.\"  She  did not speak, but she gave him her hand.  Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her on to  his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great  rejoicings.  The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber, and held in  great honour.\\n<p> From Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, <em>Household Tales</em>, trans.

       "[<div class=\"GM\" id=\"text\">\\n         <p align=\"justify\">In old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose  daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the  sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in  her face.  Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an   old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm,  the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the  cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it  up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favourite plaything.</p>\\n         <p> Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did   not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the  ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.  The King's daughter  followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep  that the bottom could not be seen.  On this she began to cry, and cried  louder and louder, and could not be comforted.  And as she thus lamented,  some one said to her, \"What ails thee, King's daughter?  Thou weepest so  that even a stone would show pity.\"  She looked round to the side from whence  the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water.    \"Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?\" said she; \"I am weeping for my golden ball,  which has fallen into the well.\"</p>\\n         <p> \"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help thee, but what wilt   thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?\"  \"Whatever thou wilt have, dear   frog,\" said she \"my clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown   which I am wearing.\"</p>\\n         <p> The frog answered, \"I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or   thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and   play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate,   and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed if thou wilt promise   me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.\"</p>\\n         <p> \"Oh, yes,\" said she, \"I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but  bring me my ball back again.\"  She, however, thought, \"How the silly   frog does talk!  He lives in the water with the other frogs and croaks,   and can be no companion to any human being!\"</p>\\n         <p> But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the  water and sank down, and in a short time came swimming up again with   the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.  The King's daughter was  delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran  away with it.  \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog, \"Take me with thee.  I can't run   as thou canst.\"  But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after   her, as loudly as he could?  She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon   forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.</p>\\n         <p> The next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all  the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came  creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it   had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, \"Princess, youngest   princess, open the door for me.\"  She ran to see who was outside, but when   she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it.  Then she slammed the   door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened.    The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My   child, what art thou so afraid of?  Is there perchance a giant outside who   wants to carry thee away?\"  \"Ah, no,\" replied she, \"it is no giant, but a   disgusting frog.\"</p>\\n         <p> \"What does the frog want with thee?\"  \"Ah, dear father, yesterday when   I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the  water.  And because I cried so the frog brought it out again for me, and  because he insisted so on it, I promised him he should be my companion,   but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water!  And now   he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"</p>\\n         <p> In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,</p>\\n         <p> </p>\\n         <blockquote> \"Princess! youngest princess!<br/>\\n           Open the door for me!<br/>\\n           Dost thou not know what thou saidst to me<br/>\\n           Yesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?<br/>\\n           Princess, youngest princess!<br/>\\n           Open the door for me!\" </blockquote>\\nThen said the King, \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform.   Go and let him in.\"  She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped   in and followed her, step by step, to her chair.  There he sat still and cried,   \"Lift me up beside thee.\"  She delayed, until at last the King commanded her   to do it.  When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table,   and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push thy little golden plate nearer   to me that we may eat together.\"  She did this, but it was easy to see that she   did not do it willingly.  The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every   mouthful she took choked her.  At length he said, \"I have eaten and am   satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little   silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\\n<p> The King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog  which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty,  clean little bed.  But the King grew angry and said, \"He who helped thee  when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.\"  So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put  him in a corner.  But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, \"I am  tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.\"    Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her   might against the wall.  \"Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,\" said she.    But when he fell down he was no frog but a king's son with beautiful kind   eyes.  He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband.    Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how   no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow   they would go together into his kingdom.  Then they went to sleep, and next   morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight   white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were   harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant   faithful Henry.  Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was   changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his   heart, lest it should burst with grief andsadness.  The carriage was to conduct   the young King into his kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and   placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance.    And when they had driven a part of the way, the King's son heard a cracking   behind him as if something had broken.  So he turned round and cried, \"Henry,   the carriage is breaking.\"</p>\\n<p> \"No, master, it is not the carriage.  It is a band from my heart, which was   put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.\"    Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and   each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only   the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his   master was set free and was happy. </p>\\n<p> From Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, <em>Household Tales</em>, trans.
