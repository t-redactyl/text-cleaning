       " 'of the little stream, seem all to be reflected in the popular tales and',\n",
       " 'superstitions.  The acquaintance with nature in a severe, grand, and',\n",
       " 'somewhat terrible form must necessarily have its effect on the human',\n",

       " 'Now it chanced many years since that there lived on the Borders a jolly',\n",
       " 'rattling horse-cowper, who was remarkable for a reckless and fearless',\n",
       " 'temper, which made him much admired and a little dreaded amongst his',\n",
       " 'neighbours.  One moonlight night, as he rode over Bowden Moor, on the',\n",
       " \"west side of the Eildon Hills, the scene of Thomas the Rhymer's\",\n",
       " 'prophecies, and often mentioned in his history, having a brace of horses',\n",
       " 'along with him, which he had not been able to dispose of, he met a man of',\n",
       " 'venerable appearance and singularly antique dress, who, to his great',\n",
       " 'surprise, asked the price of his horses, and began to chaffer with him on',\n",
       " 'the subject.  To Canobie Dick, for so shall we call our Border dealer, a',\n",
       " 'chap was a chap, and he would have sold a horse to the devil himself,',\n",
       " 'without minding his cloven hoof, and would have probably cheated Old Nick',\n",
       " 'into the bargain.  The stranger paid the price they agreed on, and all',\n",
       " 'that puzzled Dick in the transaction was, that the gold which he received',\n",
       " 'was in unicorns, bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins, which would have',\n",
       " 'been invaluable to collectors, but were rather troublesome in modern',\n",
       " 'currency.  It was gold, however, and therefore Dick contrived to get',\n",
       " 'better value for the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer.  By the',\n",
       " 'command of so good a merchant, he brought horses to the same spot more',\n",
       " 'than once; the purchaser only stipulating that he should always come by',\n",
       " 'night and alone.  I do not know whether it was from mere curiosity, or',\n",
       " 'whether some hope of gain mixed with it, but after Dick had sold several',\n",
       " 'horses in this way, he began to complain that dry bargains were unlucky,',\n",
       " 'and to hint, that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood, he',\n",
       " 'ought, in the courtesy of dealing, to treat him to half a mutchkin.',\n",
       " '\"You may see my dwelling if you will,\" said the stranger; \"but if you',\n",
       " 'lose courage at what you see there, you will rue it all your life.\"',\n",
       " 'Dickon, however, laughed the warning to scorn, and having alighted to',\n",
       " 'secure his horse, he followed the stranger up a narrow footpath, which',\n",
       " 'led them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the most',\n",
       " 'southern and the centre peaks, and called, from its resemblance to such',\n",
       " 'an animal in its form, the Lucken Hare.  At the foot of this eminence,',\n",
       " 'which is almost as famous for witch-meetings as the neighbouring windmill',\n",
       " 'of Kippilaw, Dick was somewhat startled to observe that his conductor',\n",
       " 'entered the hillside by a passage or cavern, of which he himself, though',\n",
       " 'well acquainted with the spot, had never seen nor heard.',\n",
       " '\"You may still return,\" said his guide, looking ominously back upon him;',\n",

       " 'horse; by every horse lay a knight in coal-black armour, with a drawn',\n",
       " 'sword in his hand; but all were as silent, hoof and limb, as if they had',\n",
       " 'been cut out of marble.  A great number of torches lent a gloomy lustre',\n",
       " 'to the hall, which, like those of the Caliph Vathek, was of large',\n",
       " 'dimensions.  At the upper end, however, they at length arrived, where a',\n",

       " 'taking the sword or horn first.\"',\n",
       " 'Dick was much disposed to take the sword, but his bold spirit was quailed',\n",
       " 'by the supernatural terrors of the hall, and he thought to unsheathe the',\n",
       " 'sword first might be construed into defiance, and give offence to the',\n",
       " 'powers of the mountain.  He took the bugle with a trembling hand, and',\n",
       " 'blew a feeble note, but loud enough to produce a terrible answer.  Thunder',\n",
       " 'rolled in stunning peals through the immense hall; horses and men started',\n",
       " 'to life; the steeds snorted, stamped, ground their bits, and tossed their',\n",
       " 'heads; the warriors sprang to their feet, clashed their armour, and',\n",
       " \"brandished their swords.  Dick's terror was extreme at seeing the whole\",\n",
       " 'army, which had been so lately silent as the grave, in uproar, and about',\n",
       " 'to rush on him.  He dropped the horn, and made a feeble attempt to seize',\n",

       " '\"Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,',\n",
       " 'Who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!\"',\n",
