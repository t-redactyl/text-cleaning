    "In the last chapter, we covered how we could extract a clean, normalised bag-of-words from our collections of tales. In this chapter, we are going to start doing something useful with them. Specifically, we are going to have a look at the frequency of terms within our tales in order to work out which of them are the most similar. Moreover, we will work out how to retrieve those documents that are most similar to a certain set of terms. Going forward, we'll only use the English-language tales, but you can use all of the techniques I'll cover in this and all of the remaining chapters for most languages.\n",

    "As we saw in the previous chapter, one of the most basic things we can do once we've cleaned and tokenised our documents is to take a frequency count of all of the words. In the last chapter, I took a frequency of the whole corpus, but to give us a bit more insight into our texts let's break this down by story. We'll do this for the first 5 stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, use a method from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` called `CountVectorizer`. We can use the `fit_transform` function to create what is called a term density matrix for each of the terms in each tale. We'll start with the most basic form, which gives us a simple count of how many times each word occurs in each tale."
