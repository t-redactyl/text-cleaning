    "In the last chapter, we covered how we could extract a clean, normalised bag-of-words from our collections of tales. In this chapter, we are going to start doing something useful with them. Specifically, we are going to have a look at the frequency of terms within our tales in order to work out which of them are the most similar. Moreover, we will work out how to retrieve those documents that are most similar to a certain set of terms. Going forward, we'll only use the English-language tales, but you can use all of the techniques I'll cover in this and all of the remaining chapters for most languages.\n",

In the last chapter, I took a frequency of the whole corpus, but to give us a bit more insight into our texts let's break this down by story. We'll do this for the first 5 stories.\n",

    "To do this, use a method from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` called `CountVectorizer`. We can use the `fit_transform` function to create what is called a term density matrix for each of the terms in each tale. We'll start with the most basic form, which gives us a simple count of how many times each word occurs in each tale."

The problem with using the raw frequency of each word is the terms that are common in longer documents automatically get scaled up compared to those contained in other documents. In addition, because most terms are more frequent in longer documents, it is difficult to see how relatively important individual words are when documents have different lengths.\n",

Let's do this with our term frequency matrix, and reorder the columns so the terms with the highest proportion per document end up at the front."

However, you might have noticed *another* problem we now have. While we got rid of stop words in the cleaning process, the top 15 words is still dominated by words like 'say', 'come' and 'go', which don't really offer much unique information as to what each story is about. Luckily, there is another way we can deal with this, which we'll discuss in the next section.\n",
