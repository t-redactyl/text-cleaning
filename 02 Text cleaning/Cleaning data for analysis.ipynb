    "# Chapter 2: Cleaning the text for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most basic (and most important) tasks when doing text mining is cleaning up your text. While this might seem a bit dull compared to some of the things we'll do later in the book, I hope to show you in this post that not only is this pretty straightforward with the right Python packages, it can also help you to get to know your data before you get stuck into modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, the ultimate aim of cleaning is to transform text from sentences into a standardised [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) for some of our later analyses, but you'll also see that we'll pick and choose from these methods to get our text into other formats more appropriate for other analyses. To demonstrate the flexibility of these packages, I'll show you how we can process both the English- and German-language Grimm's fairytales that we scraped in the last chapter (and by extension a few other common languages) using similar methods. \n",

For example, in the opening line to *The Frog-King* words such as 'king', 'daughter' and 'beautiful' give a pretty good idea of what the sentence is about. As you might guess, these frequencies rely on these signal words being in the exact same format. However, the same word often has different representations depending on the context. The word 'camp', for example, can be 'camped', 'camps' and 'camping', but these words all ultimately mean the same thing and should be grouped together in a bag-of-words analysis.\n",
